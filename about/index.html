<p>In my personal life, I'm a husband and father of two. My wife runs a
<a href="https://www.funathomewithkids.com/">fantastic blog</a>, and has written
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Asia-Citro/e/B00KODFI6E">several books</a> filled with
awesome activities and (more importantly!) pictures of our wee ones. In my
&ldquo;copious spare time&rdquo;, I like rock climbing, hiking, and biking.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p><img src="/work_profile_pic.jpg" alt="Work pic"></p>
<p>On the professional side, I'm currently a Software Engineer at Google in
Seattle. I'm currently on the
<a href="https://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/08/doing-data-science-with-colaboratory.html">Colaboratory</a>
team, and I've worked on several projects here, including
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/">BigQuery</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/google/apitools">apitools</a>, and
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>.</p>
<p>(Yes, that's actually my profile picture at work. I'm a terribly serious
person, as you can tell.)</p>
<p>Before starting at Google, I was a number theorist. I finished my PhD in 2009
at UCLA under <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~hida">Haruzo Hida</a>, and soon I'll get
some papers and whatnot linked here.</p>
<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actually updating this webpage. Still in progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm a maintainer of the <a href="https://github.com/rstats-db/bigrquery">bigrquery</a>
R package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm writing an R package called
<a href="https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gauth">gauth</a>, with the goal of making auth
for Google APIs less painful in R.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I added support for R to <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis-CI</a>, first as
<a href="https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis">a shim at runtime</a>, and later as
<a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/">an official language</a>
(<a href="https://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-02-26-test-your-r-applications-on-travis-ci/">blog post</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I spent several years heavily involved with
<a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</a>. I haven't had much time to write any code
in Sage lately, but I did help William get
<a href="https://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/09/collaborative-mathematics-with.html">funding from Google Research</a>
to fund SageMathCloud development.</p>

</ul>
