      <description>Food Can&amp;rsquo;t miss  Rose&amp;rsquo;s Bakery Cafe is one of our absolute favorites. Amazing baked goods, but their whole lunch menu is great (especially if there&amp;rsquo;s halibut). They also have a bunch of interesting snacks in the bakery &amp;ndash; one worth calling out are the crackers. They&amp;rsquo;re these slightly thick crackers with nuts and raisins, and they&amp;rsquo;re totally delightful. For lunch they also have a provolone sandwich that sounds like &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rsquo;mon really?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been forever since I lived in LA, but I still long for some of the food. One of my friends asked for some food recs, so I&amp;rsquo;m recording them here:
Amazing eats   Amandine: go and get the french toast, and then get anything else that sounds good. It&amp;rsquo;s my absolute favorite french toast in the known universe, which is a strong compliment. Every pastry I had was good; I remember the coffee being good, but that was before I lived in Seattle, so that&amp;rsquo;s harder to say.</description>

      <description>Cambridge, MA has one of the best concentrations of great eateries of any place I&amp;rsquo;ve ever lived; here&amp;rsquo;s the list of my favorites, dated from the last time I sent it along to someone. (I know at least Herrell&amp;rsquo;s is gone, which is a crime against humanity.)
  Darwin&amp;rsquo;s: my favorite place in Cambridge. There are two of them in Cambridge, one on Mt. Auburn, one on Cambridge St. The one on Cambridge St.</description>
