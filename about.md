In my personal life, I'm a husband and father of two. My wife runs a
[publishing company](https://www.theinnovationpress.com/), and has written
[several books](https://www.amazon.com/Asia-Citro/e/B00KODFI6E). In my
"copious spare time", I'm usually running.

## Work

On the professional side, I'm currently a Software Engineer at Google. I'm
currently on the [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) team, and I've
worked on several projects here, including
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/),
[apitools](https://github.com/google/apitools), and
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Before starting at Google, I was a number theorist. I finished my PhD in 2009
at UCLA under [Haruzo Hida](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~hida), and soon I'll get
some papers and whatnot linked here.

## Projects

* Actually updating this webpage. Still in progress.

* I've helped maintain the [bigrquery](https://github.com/rstats-db/bigrquery)
  R package, and I wrote an initial version of what became
  [gargle](https://gargle.r-lib.org/).

* I added support for R to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), first as
  [a shim at runtime](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis), and later as
  [an official language](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/)
  ([blog post](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-02-26-test-your-r-applications-on-travis-ci/)).

* I spent several years heavily involved with
  [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/). I haven't had much time to write any code
  in Sage lately, but I did help William get
  [funding from Google Research](https://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/09/collaborative-mathematics-with.html)
  to fund SageMathCloud development.
