<p>You should stop and read this right away, if you haven&rsquo;t already. It&rsquo;s a
fairly harsh and biting attack on the state of math education (and more
specifically K-12 math education) in the US. His main point is that the focus
of the K-12 math curriculum has essentially nothing to do with the actual
practice of mathematics, which is true. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but there&rsquo;s almost
nothing I actually disagree with in it &ndash; its only real sins are sins of
omission. Here are my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lockhart does an excellent job of talking about the problem, but says
nothing about ways to solve the problem. I strongly agree that the state of
education in general, and math education in particular, is fairly bad in the
US. However, just saying that over and over isn&rsquo;t going to fix anything. I&rsquo;d
be curious to hear what he thinks about ways to fix the system, other than the
obvious &ndash; just overhaul the whole thing. I&rsquo;ll save most of my ranting for
another post, save for this: I don&rsquo;t see how we&rsquo;re going to fix the system
until we find a way to make being a teacher &ndash; especially a teacher at a
public school &ndash; an actually desirable job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think Lockhart also gives a bit more credit to teaching in other areas
than they deserve. He speaks as though the curriculum in english or the
sciences is great &ndash; clearly he didn&rsquo;t have my middle and high school
experience. :) That said, it does fit with his primary theme &ndash; I think there
was much more similarity between my high school english classes and the job of
a literary critic than between my high school math classes and the job of a
mathematician, especially a research mathematician in pure math.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that Lockhart also underplays the value of some amount of rote
exercises, especially for younger math students. However, I think the point
that he&rsquo;s trying to make is that rote exercises without any motivation
whatsoever are pointless &ndash; and I agree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lockhart seems to take the point of view that the reason for doing math is
to do research in pure math. He doesn&rsquo;t seem to take much time to talk about
math as a tool for physics or engineering, which is just silly. Of course, his
attacks still apply &ndash; my experience is that students of engineering take
calculus classes because they&rsquo;re required, but don&rsquo;t actually understand why
they&rsquo;re doing it until later on. Sadly, because they had no idea what they
were doing or why, they also generally don&rsquo;t remember any of the techniques
they learned, either.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I want to say again, though, that I loved this article. Even if there were
things that were missing, there was so much good in it. Of course, I don&rsquo;t
seem to be the only one &hellip; here&rsquo;s a link to
<a href="https://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=410">the blog post</a> that first pointed me to
the article, and another link with info
<a href="https://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_03_08.html">about Lockhart himself</a>.</p>
