<p>It&rsquo;s been forever since I lived in LA, but I still long for some of the food.
One of my friends asked for some food recs, so I&rsquo;m recording them here:</p>

<h2 id="amazing-eats">Amazing eats</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Amandine</strong>: go and get the french toast, and then get anything else that
sounds good. It&rsquo;s my absolute favorite french toast in the known universe,
which is a strong compliment. Every pastry I had was good; I remember the
coffee being good, but that was before I lived in Seattle, so that&rsquo;s harder to
say.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Bay Cities Italian Deli</strong>: it&rsquo;s a big deli that also makes sandwiches; you
can go in and take a number, or just order online like a sane person. Lines
that can sometimes put paseo to shame. the sandwiches are incredible. (I
always got the godmother, I think?)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Abbot Kinney Pizza</strong>: they do a bunch of awesome pizzas with a bagel crust,
and it&rsquo;s fantastic. If you can, go to the one in venice (they usually have
more pizza options on hand).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>India Sweets &amp; Spices</strong>: another not-fancy-but-delicious place, down in
Culver City; it&rsquo;s also primarily a grocery store that happens to sell amazing
food. (vegetarian)</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Pita Pockets</strong>: this one is up in the Valley, so if you&rsquo;re not already
headed that way, may be further than you want to go. But holy cow, the laffa
wraps are out of this world. They also have amazing hummus, and I drool
thinking about their falafel laffa wrap with hummus.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>C&amp;O Trattoria</strong>: this is a fantastic place to go if you&rsquo;re looking for a
MASSIVE amount of fresh garlic rolls and pasta. It&rsquo;s tasty, but maybe not the
best pasta in the universe, with self-service wine at the table. If you&rsquo;re
going with a bunch of friends, this one&rsquo;s hard to beat, and you can take a
nice walk on the beach in Venice after.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="desserts">Desserts</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Pinkberry</strong>: this is the place that made tart yogurt famous; I don&rsquo;t know
if it&rsquo;s still up to its former glory, but it was reeeeeally good when it first
came along.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Scoops</strong>: this used to only be waaaaaay over on the east side of LA, but
is now apparently on the westside. One of the most amazing ice cream shops
I&rsquo;ve been to.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Susie Cakes</strong>: this was the first place I had a really, really amazing
cupcake. Some of their cupcakes and cookies are out of this world, and others
are just so-so. So take that one with a grain of &hellip; sugar?</p></li>
</ul>
