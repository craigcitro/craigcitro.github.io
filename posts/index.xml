      <description>Food Can&amp;rsquo;t miss  Rose&amp;rsquo;s Bakery Cafe is one of our absolute favorites. Amazing baked goods, but their whole lunch menu is great (especially if there&amp;rsquo;s halibut). They also have a bunch of interesting snacks in the bakery &amp;ndash; one worth calling out are the crackers. They&amp;rsquo;re these slightly thick crackers with nuts and raisins, and they&amp;rsquo;re totally delightful. For lunch they also have a provolone sandwich that sounds like &amp;ldquo;c&amp;rsquo;mon really?</description>

      <description>People often ask me for advice about how to get a job at Google, especially research mathematicians. This post is basically the common parts from my emails on the topic, for better discoverability.
This often breaks down into one of two questions:
 Would I be happy working as a software engineer at (a place like) Google?
 What should I do to get ready for the interview?
  Some of this was from a discussion with William Stein, who used it in a nice and related blog post.</description>

      <title>LA food recs</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been forever since I lived in LA, but I still long for some of the food. One of my friends asked for some food recs, so I&amp;rsquo;m recording them here:
Amazing eats  Amandine: go and get the french toast, and then get anything else that sounds good. It&amp;rsquo;s my absolute favorite french toast in the known universe, which is a strong compliment. Every pastry I had was good; I remember the coffee being good, but that was before I lived in Seattle, so that&amp;rsquo;s harder to say.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m finally finding time to start straightening up my web presence, and step one involves updating this site. In the process, I&amp;rsquo;m setting up a blog. This includes a few of the old posts from my blogspot blog, as well as one post I wrote a year ago but apparently never posted.
More to come &amp;ndash; but if there&amp;rsquo;s anything you&amp;rsquo;ve asked me for a link to, ask again and I&amp;rsquo;ll put it up here.</description>

      <title>Managing Bookmarks</title>
      <link>https://www.craigcitro.org/posts/2014-12-22-managing-bookmarks/</link>

      <description>Like everyone, I often run into interesting content that I don&amp;rsquo;t have time to read then and there. Bookmarks to the rescue!
But then I end up with a mountain of bookmarks. After years of experimenting, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally come up with an effective system.
The System  Bookmark things in chrome (or your browser of choice) as you find them.
 Roughly once a month, make a few folders to try and do some basic grouping.</description>

      <description>I saw these on mathoverflow:
 The primary reason Bourbaki stopped writing books was the realization that Lang was one single person. A paper should be like a miniskirt: short enough to be interesting and long enough to cover the subject.  </description>

      <title>Lockhart&#39;s Lament</title>

      <description>I recently stumbled upon a link to Lockhart&amp;rsquo;s Lament.
You should stop and read this right away, if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly harsh and biting attack on the state of math education (and more specifically K-12 math education) in the US. His main point is that the focus of the K-12 math curriculum has essentially nothing to do with the actual practice of mathematics, which is true. It&amp;rsquo;s not perfect, but there&amp;rsquo;s almost nothing I actually disagree with in it &amp;ndash; its only real sins are sins of omission.</description>

      <description>Cambridge, MA has one of the best concentrations of great eateries of any place I&amp;rsquo;ve ever lived; here&amp;rsquo;s the list of my favorites, dated from the last time I sent it along to someone. (I know at least Herrell&amp;rsquo;s is gone, which is a crime against humanity.)
 Darwin&amp;rsquo;s: my favorite place in Cambridge. There are two of them in Cambridge, one on Mt. Auburn, one on Cambridge St. The one on Cambridge St.</description>
