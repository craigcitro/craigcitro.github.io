<h3 id="can-t-miss">Can&rsquo;t miss</h3>

<ul>
<li>Rose&rsquo;s Bakery Cafe is one of our absolute favorites. Amazing baked goods,
but their whole lunch menu is great (especially if there&rsquo;s halibut). They
also have a bunch of interesting snacks in the bakery &ndash; one worth calling
out are the crackers. They&rsquo;re these slightly thick crackers with nuts and
raisins, and they&rsquo;re totally delightful. For lunch they also have a
provolone sandwich that sounds like &ldquo;c&rsquo;mon really?!&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s FANTASTIC
every time.</li>
<li>Voyager Sandwiches is phenomenal: we get the tofu banh mi and it&rsquo;s
outstanding; my father-in-law does the roast pork sanguche on baguette and
sings high praise for it.</li>
<li>Hogstone&rsquo;s is also <strong>so</strong> good. We&rsquo;ve probably been there 15+ times, and we
did have <em>one</em> bad pizza where I think they accidentally salted it twice and
Asia was like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m eating seawater&rdquo;. Literally every other pizza we&rsquo;ve had
there has been out of this world delicious.</li>
<li>Clever Cow Creamery: make sure to get a waffle cone, because they make them
on site. The london fog (earl grey) and peanut butter chocolate are my
faves; the fruit flavors are also outstanding.</li>
<li>Doe Bay Cafe&rsquo;s brunch is top-notch; if you can get in there sunday morning
or afternoon for brunch, you should 100% do it. I assume their other meals
are just as delightful, but we&rsquo;ve only ever been for brunch.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="new-entrants">New Entrants</h3>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried these, but they look promising:</p>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s a new place called Matia that we haven&rsquo;t had a chance to try yet but
I think is going to be insanely good. (c&rsquo;mon &ldquo;Strawberry Toast, Cherry
Tomatoes, Whipped Sheep’s Cheese, Chili Honey&rdquo; how could that be anything
but magic?)</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a bakery called Seabird whose
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/seabirdbakeshop/">insta</a> speaks for itself.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a salvadoran taco stand that sets up next to Ray&rsquo;s pharmacy, but I
haven&rsquo;t had a chance to go. My father in law went once and said the tacos
were great, but the tamales were amazing.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="solid-choices">Solid choices</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;re never really on Orcas for more than a day trip, so we almost always get
some mix of the places above and don&rsquo;t have time to explore. That said, you
can&rsquo;t go wrong with any of these:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Kitchen: I had one quick lunch here with my then-6-year-old and we both
came away happy.</li>
<li>Wild Island: we ended up getting this to go once when Voyager was closed and
it was a crowd pleaser.</li>
<li>Brown Bear Baking: if you moved Brown Bear to most other towns, it&rsquo;d be an
easy favorite, but it&rsquo;s got stiff competition with Rose&rsquo;s just down the
street. The kouign-amann is my go-to; the pastries tend to be a little
sugarier than I&rsquo;d like.</li>
<li>The Mansion Restaurant at Rosario: we had a stellar dinner here one night,
with particularly good fish.
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="non-food">Non-food</h2>

<p>I mean, you&rsquo;ve gotta do <em>something</em> between meals, right?</p>

<ul>
<li>Moran State Park is one of my favorite parks anywhere. I would definitely
say the Cascade Lake Loop (~3.5 mi, hilly at the end) and the Mountain Lake
Loop (~4.5 mi) are can&rsquo;t miss, for any age. If there&rsquo;s a sunny+clear day,
going up to mount constitution is an unforgettable view.</li>
<li>Darvill&rsquo;s Bookstore is small but outstanding; it&rsquo;s what every small town
bookstore wants to be.</li>
<li>Asia and our then-10-year-old did <a href="https://www.orcasescaperoom.com/">https://www.orcasescaperoom.com/</a> and they
said it was fantastic. The guy who runs it is also a magician &ndash; on the off
chance he&rsquo;s doing a show, it&rsquo;d be worth your time.</li>
<li>Indian island: so there&rsquo;s this little island you can <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/indianislandproject/">see from
town</a> &ndash; when the tide
is REALLY low, you can walk out to it! It&rsquo;s only walkable for short windows,
so if you see the path, don&rsquo;t wait.</li>
<li>Forest Ceramic Gallery: if you&rsquo;re looking for a random-but-gorgeous gift, <a href="https://www.forestceramic.com/">https://www.forestceramic.com/</a> may have you covered.</li>
<li>Turtleback Mountain: if you somehow run out of hikes in Moran, Turtleback is
supposed to be great. I&rsquo;ve heard most of the hikes are kinda steep, so we
haven&rsquo;t tried with the kids, but I&rsquo;m looking forward to it as they get older.</li>
<li>Crescent Beach Preserve: this is a really short hike, but it&rsquo;s right next to
town, so if you&rsquo;re looking for a short stroll after breakfast or something,
it&rsquo;s an easy choice. The eponymous beach (just south of it) is a cool walk
when the tide is way out.</li>
<li>Printshop Northwest: if you want a fun souvenir, they do custom screen
printing on-site &ndash; I have a shirt that&rsquo;s a ridgeline plot of orcas in
rainbow and I freaking love it.</li>
</ul>
