There's plenty to do on Orcas -- but me being me, I have to start with the
important stuff: eating.

## Food

### Can't miss

* Rose's Bakery Cafe is one of our absolute favorites. Amazing baked goods,
  but their whole lunch menu is great (especially if there's halibut). They
  also have a bunch of interesting snacks in the bakery -- one worth calling
  out are the crackers. They're these slightly thick crackers with nuts and
  raisins, and they're totally delightful. For lunch they also have a
  provolone sandwich that sounds like "c'mon really?!" but it's FANTASTIC
  every time.
* Voyager Sandwiches is phenomenal: we get the tofu banh mi and it's
  outstanding; my father-in-law does the roast pork sanguche on baguette and
  sings high praise for it.
* Hogstone's is also **so** good. We've probably been there 15+ times, and we
  did have *one* bad pizza where I think they accidentally salted it twice and
  Asia was like "I'm eating seawater". Literally every other pizza we've had
  there has been out of this world delicious.
* Clever Cow Creamery: make sure to get a waffle cone, because they make them
  on site. The london fog (earl grey) and peanut butter chocolate are my
  faves; the fruit flavors are also outstanding.
* Doe Bay Cafe's brunch is top-notch; if you can get in there sunday morning
  or afternoon for brunch, you should 100% do it. I assume their other meals
  are just as delightful, but we've only ever been for brunch.

### New Entrants

I haven't tried these, but they look promising:

* There's a new place called Matia that we haven't had a chance to try yet but
  I think is going to be insanely good. (c'mon "Strawberry Toast, Cherry
  Tomatoes, Whipped Sheepâ€™s Cheese, Chili Honey" how could that be anything
  but magic?)
* There's a bakery called Seabird whose
  [insta](https://www.instagram.com/seabirdbakeshop/) speaks for itself.
* There's a salvadoran taco stand that sets up next to Ray's pharmacy, but I
  haven't had a chance to go. My father in law went once and said the tacos
  were great, but the tamales were amazing.

### Solid choices

We're never really on Orcas for more than a day trip, so we almost always get
some mix of the places above and don't have time to explore. That said, you
can't go wrong with any of these:

* The Kitchen: I had one quick lunch here with my then-6-year-old and we both
  came away happy.
* Wild Island: we ended up getting this to go once when Voyager was closed and
  it was a crowd pleaser.
* Brown Bear Baking: if you moved Brown Bear to most other towns, it'd be an
  easy favorite, but it's got stiff competition with Rose's just down the
  street. The kouign-amann is my go-to; the pastries tend to be a little
  sugarier than I'd like.
* The Mansion Restaurant at Rosario: we had a stellar dinner here one night,
  with particularly good fish.
  
## Non-food

I mean, you've gotta do *something* between meals, right?

* Moran State Park is one of my favorite parks anywhere. I would definitely
  say the Cascade Lake Loop (~3.5 mi, hilly at the end) and the Mountain Lake
  Loop (~4.5 mi) are can't miss, for any age. If there's a sunny+clear day,
  going up to mount constitution is an unforgettable view.
* Darvill's Bookstore is small but outstanding; it's what every small town
  bookstore wants to be.
* Asia and our then-10-year-old did https://www.orcasescaperoom.com/ and they
  said it was fantastic. The guy who runs it is also a magician -- on the off
  chance he's doing a show, it'd be worth your time.
* Indian island: so there's this little island you can [see from
  town](https://sites.google.com/site/indianislandproject/) -- when the tide
  is REALLY low, you can walk out to it! It's only walkable for short windows,
  so if you see the path, don't wait.
* Forest Ceramic Gallery: if you're looking for a random-but-gorgeous gift, https://www.forestceramic.com/ may have you covered.
* Turtleback Mountain: if you somehow run out of hikes in Moran, Turtleback is
  supposed to be great. I've heard most of the hikes are kinda steep, so we
  haven't tried with the kids, but I'm looking forward to it as they get older.
* Crescent Beach Preserve: this is a really short hike, but it's right next to
  town, so if you're looking for a short stroll after breakfast or something,
  it's an easy choice. The eponymous beach (just south of it) is a cool walk
  when the tide is way out.
* Printshop Northwest: if you want a fun souvenir, they do custom screen
  printing on-site -- I have a shirt that's a ridgeline plot of orcas in
  rainbow and I freaking love it.
