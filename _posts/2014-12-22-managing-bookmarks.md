Like everyone, I often run into interesting content that I don't have time to
read then and there. Bookmarks to the rescue!

But then I end up with a
mountain of bookmarks. After years of experimenting, I've finally come up with
an effective system.

The System
----------

1. Bookmark things in chrome (or your browser of choice) as you find them.

2. Roughly once a month, make a few folders to try and do some basic grouping.

3. About once every 6 weeks, remember that you'd seen an interesting link on a
specific topic, but you can't seem to find it.

4. At about three months, realize you've now bookmarked more content than you
could read in a month. Declare bankruptcy, delete all links you can't read in
that sitting, and start over.

In a later post, I plan to apply this same technique to handling email.
