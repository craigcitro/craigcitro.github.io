important stuff: eating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;food&quot;&gt;Food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cant-miss&quot;&gt;Can’t miss&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rose’s Bakery Cafe is one of our absolute favorites. Amazing baked goods,
but their whole lunch menu is great (especially if there’s halibut). They
also have a bunch of interesting snacks in the bakery – one worth calling
out are the crackers. They’re these slightly thick crackers with nuts and
raisins, and they’re totally delightful. For lunch they also have a
provolone sandwich that sounds like “c’mon really?!” but it’s FANTASTIC
every time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Voyager Sandwiches is phenomenal: we get the tofu banh mi and it’s
outstanding; my father-in-law does the roast pork sanguche on baguette and
sings high praise for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hogstone’s is also &lt;strong&gt;so&lt;/strong&gt; good. We’ve probably been there 15+ times, and we
did have &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; bad pizza where I think they accidentally salted it twice and
Asia was like “I’m eating seawater”. Literally every other pizza we’ve had
there has been out of this world delicious.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clever Cow Creamery: make sure to get a waffle cone, because they make them
on site. The london fog (earl grey) and peanut butter chocolate are my
faves; the fruit flavors are also outstanding.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doe Bay Cafe’s brunch is top-notch; if you can get in there sunday morning
or afternoon for brunch, you should 100% do it. I assume their other meals
are just as delightful, but we’ve only ever been for brunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;new-entrants&quot;&gt;New Entrants&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t tried these, but they look promising:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a new place called Matia that we haven’t had a chance to try yet but
I think is going to be insanely good. (c’mon “Strawberry Toast, Cherry
Tomatoes, Whipped Sheep’s Cheese, Chili Honey” how could that be anything
but magic?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a bakery called Seabird whose
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/seabirdbakeshop/&quot;&gt;insta&lt;/a&gt; speaks for itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a salvadoran taco stand that sets up next to Ray’s pharmacy, but I
haven’t had a chance to go. My father in law went once and said the tacos
were great, but the tamales were amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;solid-choices&quot;&gt;Solid choices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re never really on Orcas for more than a day trip, so we almost always get
some mix of the places above and don’t have time to explore. That said, you
can’t go wrong with any of these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Kitchen: I had one quick lunch here with my then-6-year-old and we both
came away happy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wild Island: we ended up getting this to go once when Voyager was closed and
it was a crowd pleaser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Brown Bear Baking: if you moved Brown Bear to most other towns, it’d be an
easy favorite, but it’s got stiff competition with Rose’s just down the
street. The kouign-amann is my go-to; the pastries tend to be a little
sugarier than I’d like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Mansion Restaurant at Rosario: we had a stellar dinner here one night,
with particularly good fish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;non-food&quot;&gt;Non-food&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, you’ve gotta do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; between meals, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Moran State Park is one of my favorite parks anywhere. I would definitely
say the Cascade Lake Loop (~3.5 mi, hilly at the end) and the Mountain Lake
Loop (~4.5 mi) are can’t miss, for any age. If there’s a sunny+clear day,
going up to mount constitution is an unforgettable view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Darvill’s Bookstore is small but outstanding; it’s what every small town
bookstore wants to be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Asia and our then-10-year-old did https://www.orcasescaperoom.com/ and they
said it was fantastic. The guy who runs it is also a magician – on the off
chance he’s doing a show, it’d be worth your time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Indian island: so there’s this little island you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/site/indianislandproject/&quot;&gt;see from
town&lt;/a&gt; – when the tide
is REALLY low, you can walk out to it! It’s only walkable for short windows,
so if you see the path, don’t wait.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forest Ceramic Gallery: if you’re looking for a random-but-gorgeous gift, https://www.forestceramic.com/ may have you covered.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turtleback Mountain: if you somehow run out of hikes in Moran, Turtleback is
supposed to be great. I’ve heard most of the hikes are kinda steep, so we
haven’t tried with the kids, but I’m looking forward to it as they get older.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crescent Beach Preserve: this is a really short hike, but it’s right next to
town, so if you’re looking for a short stroll after breakfast or something,
it’s an easy choice. The eponymous beach (just south of it) is a cool walk
when the tide is way out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Printshop Northwest: if you want a fun souvenir, they do custom screen
printing on-site – I have a shirt that’s a ridgeline plot of orcas in
rainbow and I freaking love it.&lt;/li&gt;

research mathematicians. This post is basically the common parts from my
emails on the topic, for better discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This often breaks down into one of two questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Would I be happy working as a software engineer at (a place like) Google?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What should I do to get ready for the interview?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of this was from a discussion with William Stein, who used it in a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://sagemath.blogspot.com/2016/01/mathematics-graduate-school-preparation.html&quot;&gt;nice and related blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;going-into-software-esp-from-academia&quot;&gt;Going into software (esp. from academia)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;My main piece of advice to potential Google applicants is “start writing as
much code as you can, right now.” The main goal here is to find out whether
you’d actually &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; working for a company like Google, where a large chunk
of your job is coding in front of a screen. I’ve had several friends from math
discover (the hard way) that they don’t really enjoy full-time programming
(any more than they enjoy full-time teaching?), but only once they were 6
months into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Part of this is really a question about your own personality: if you’re the
type of person that finds engrossing new problems everywhere you look, then
industry may well be a lot of fun. On the other hand, if you’ve got an area of
research that you love, and you can’t imagine working on anything else,
academia is the place to be … unless that area of research happens to be ad
click prediction, in which case you can pick either. :P&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start throwing things on github now. Potential interviewers are &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to
check out your github profile; having some cool stuff at the top is great, but
seeing a regular stream of commits is also a useful signal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I liken the interview process at the top companies as much like applying to
grad school: it’s quite hard to say “I’m going to go to &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; school,”
because there’s just too much randomness in the process. Instead, you should
apply to at least 3 good companies, and have a fallback or two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If someone has no real experience in any language, I generally say “start
with Java.” Some people will tell you it’s a boring language, but it’s used
lots of places, and as they say, “no one ever got fired for choosing Java.”
Plus, Java is a lot
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2014/05/01/modern-java/&quot;&gt;snazzier&lt;/a&gt; than it
used to be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-interview-mechanics&quot;&gt;Google interview mechanics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s lots of good advice out there – I think
&lt;a href=&quot;https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html&quot;&gt;Steve Yegge’s post&lt;/a&gt;
(from which I stole the title here) gives a great overview. I’ll give a few
pieces of advice that he doesn’t highlight:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During the interview, think out loud as much as possible. Honestly, the
interviewers are much more interested in &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you work on the problem than
what you end up coding. This is sometimes hard to do (especially without
feeling a little self-conscious when you’re stuck), but it’s well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Between now and the interview, spend as much time as you can coding. I know
this sounds obvious, but it’s easy to lose track of, especially if you’re busy
with your current job. All the stuff you read online will tell you that you
need to know every algorithms book backwards and forwards; the most
complicated data structure I used in my interview was a linked list. It’s good
to have a bunch of that in your head, but it’s more important to make it clear
that you’re comfortable actually coding. Multiple folks I’ve referred got
tripped up by this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you’ve never done a software interview before, try to get some friends to
do mock interviews. This will be good for thinking out loud, but also to get
you in the habit of writing code at a board. It’s not something many people do
often, especially in these days of omnipresent computing … I’ve written more
code via cellphone than whiteboard in the last year, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

One of my friends asked for some food recs, so I’m recording them here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amazing-eats&quot;&gt;Amazing eats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amandine&lt;/strong&gt;: go and get the french toast, and then get anything else that
sounds good. It’s my absolute favorite french toast in the known universe,
which is a strong compliment. Every pastry I had was good; I remember the
coffee being good, but that was before I lived in Seattle, so that’s harder to
say.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bay Cities Italian Deli&lt;/strong&gt;: it’s a big deli that also makes sandwiches; you
can go in and take a number, or just order online like a sane person. Lines
that can sometimes put paseo to shame. the sandwiches are incredible. (I
always got the godmother, I think?)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abbot Kinney Pizza&lt;/strong&gt;: they do a bunch of awesome pizzas with a bagel crust,
and it’s fantastic. If you can, go to the one in venice (they usually have
more pizza options on hand).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India Sweets &amp;amp; Spices&lt;/strong&gt;: another not-fancy-but-delicious place, down in
Culver City; it’s also primarily a grocery store that happens to sell amazing
food. (vegetarian)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pita Pockets&lt;/strong&gt;: this one is up in the Valley, so if you’re not already
headed that way, may be further than you want to go. But holy cow, the laffa
wraps are out of this world. They also have amazing hummus, and I drool
thinking about their falafel laffa wrap with hummus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&amp;amp;O Trattoria&lt;/strong&gt;: this is a fantastic place to go if you’re looking for a
MASSIVE amount of fresh garlic rolls and pasta. It’s tasty, but maybe not the
best pasta in the universe, with self-service wine at the table. If you’re
going with a bunch of friends, this one’s hard to beat, and you can take a
nice walk on the beach in Venice after.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;desserts&quot;&gt;Desserts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinkberry&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the place that made tart yogurt famous; I don’t know
if it’s still up to its former glory, but it was reeeeeally good when it first
came along.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scoops&lt;/strong&gt;: this used to only be waaaaaay over on the east side of LA, but
is now apparently on the westside. One of the most amazing ice cream shops
I’ve been to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susie Cakes&lt;/strong&gt;: this was the first place I had a really, really amazing
cupcake. Some of their cupcakes and cookies are out of this world, and others
are just so-so. So take that one with a grain of … sugar?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

read then and there. Bookmarks to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then I end up with a
mountain of bookmarks. After years of experimenting, I’ve finally come up with
an effective system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-system&quot;&gt;The System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bookmark things in chrome (or your browser of choice) as you find them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Roughly once a month, make a few folders to try and do some basic grouping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;About once every 6 weeks, remember that you’d seen an interesting link on a
specific topic, but you can’t seem to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At about three months, realize you’ve now bookmarked more content than you
could read in a month. Declare bankruptcy, delete all links you can’t read in
that sitting, and start over.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-work&quot;&gt;future work&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf&quot;&gt;Lockhart’s Lament&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should stop and read this right away, if you haven’t already. It’s a
fairly harsh and biting attack on the state of math education (and more
specifically K-12 math education) in the US. His main point is that the focus
of the K-12 math curriculum has essentially nothing to do with the actual
practice of mathematics, which is true. It’s not perfect, but there’s almost
nothing I actually disagree with in it – its only real sins are sins of
omission. Here are my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lockhart does an excellent job of talking about the problem, but says
nothing about ways to solve the problem. I strongly agree that the state of
education in general, and math education in particular, is fairly bad in the
US. However, just saying that over and over isn’t going to fix anything. I’d
be curious to hear what he thinks about ways to fix the system, other than the
obvious – just overhaul the whole thing. I’ll save most of my ranting for
another post, save for this: I don’t see how we’re going to fix the system
until we find a way to make being a teacher – especially a teacher at a
public school – an actually desirable job.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think Lockhart also gives a bit more credit to teaching in other areas
than they deserve. He speaks as though the curriculum in english or the
sciences is great – clearly he didn’t have my middle and high school
experience. :) That said, it does fit with his primary theme – I think there
was much more similarity between my high school english classes and the job of
a literary critic than between my high school math classes and the job of a
mathematician, especially a research mathematician in pure math.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;I think that Lockhart also underplays the value of some amount of rote
exercises, especially for younger math students. However, I think the point
that he’s trying to make is that rote exercises without any motivation
whatsoever are pointless – and I agree.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lockhart seems to take the point of view that the reason for doing math is
to do research in pure math. He doesn’t seem to take much time to talk about
math as a tool for physics or engineering, which is just silly. Of course, his
attacks still apply – my experience is that students of engineering take
calculus classes because they’re required, but don’t actually understand why
they’re doing it until later on. Sadly, because they had no idea what they
were doing or why, they also generally don’t remember any of the techniques
they learned, either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to say again, though, that I loved this article. Even if there were
things that were missing, there was so much good in it. Of course, I don’t
seem to be the only one … here’s a link to
&lt;a href=&quot;https://scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=410&quot;&gt;the blog post&lt;/a&gt; that first pointed me to
the article, and another link with info

place I’ve ever lived; here’s the list of my favorites, dated from the last
time I sent it along to someone. (I know at least Herrell’s is gone, which is
a crime against humanity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darwin’s&lt;/strong&gt;: my favorite place in Cambridge. There are two of them in
Cambridge, one on Mt. Auburn, one on Cambridge St. The one on Cambridge St. is
a bit bigger, but generally a bit busier. Get a sandwich, get coffee, and get
a coconut macaroon. Eat the macaroon while it’s still cold. It’s unbelievable.
(I recommend ordering at least two macaroons per person, based on personal
experience. Last time I was in Boston, I brought home 12 of them … and we’d
eaten them all in less than two days.) They also have amazing breakfast food,
but only if you get there early enough. If you only go to Harvard Square for
one meal, this is it. The last time I went to Boston, I had the cab drop me
off at Darwin’s. (If you do only have one meal in Harvard Square, don’t miss
Herrell’s on the same trip.) I have only had one bad experience – Asia’s
first sandwich there was on &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad bread (I think it was too dry, but I
don’t remember what kind it was). We went up and got her a different kind of
bread, moved the sandwich over, and it moved up to one of the five best
sandwiches she’d ever had.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Helmand&lt;/strong&gt;: This is also in Cambridge, and easiest to get to by
driving. Make a reservation, but it’s not expensive. In fact, given how
amazing the food is, it’s probably the best deal in Cambridge. Everything on
the menu is amazing. Not in the best part of town.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herrell’s Ice Cream&lt;/strong&gt;: This is some of the best ice cream anywhere, ever.
They tend to make weird flavors (like “earl grey”), which you should taste if
they sound at all good. People in Boston will try to tell you that JP Licks is
better, but they’re just plain wrong. The hot fudge is not to be missed, if
you like chocolate at all. If you don’t like chocolate, consider upgrading
your taste buds! :)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veggie Planet&lt;/strong&gt;: vegetarian pizza that’s fantastic. If you like spicy
food, I &lt;em&gt;highly&lt;/em&gt; recommend the Unsafe ‘n’ Sound, or the Safe ‘n’ Sound if you
don’t. There’s a Mexican bean pizza that’s also pretty darn good, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b. good&lt;/strong&gt;: A “healthy” burger joint, which is pretty damn tasty. A much
lighter meal than Mr. Bartley’s, and better in several ways – much more
unique, to say the least. Look at the left wall when you’re standing by the
counter to order – there’s a “monthly special” which is usually freaking
fantastic. This is (to date) still the best white bean burger I’ve had
anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Bartley’s Burgers&lt;/strong&gt;: Huge, tasty burgers. Go at an off hour if you
can, because it gets &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; busy and noisy. Don’t miss the sweet
potato fries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
